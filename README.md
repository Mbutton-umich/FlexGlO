# What is <span style="color:#39FF14;">FlexGl</span><span style="color:#FF073A;">O</span>?

Imagine a shirt that transforms your body into a living canvas of motion and energy.  
This isn't just a garment—it's a gateway to visualizing the power within. Using cutting-edge **EMG (electromyography)** sensors strategically placed across key upper-body muscle groups, this innovative shirt detects even the subtlest electrical signals generated by muscle activation. The result? A spectacular symphony of light, brought to life by vibrant **LEDs**, dynamically illuminating your movements in real-time. Witness the light of your own heart pulse on your chest, captured via **EKG (electrocardiogram)**.

## The Initial Idea

We wanted a shirt that could light-up in real-time showing muscle muscle activation as a bar of illuminated LEDs. You could check your form, you could maximize effort, you could show off. We wanted to use EMG sensors and EKG sensors too
