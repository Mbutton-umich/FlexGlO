      <h1 id="what-is-flexglo">What is <span style="color:#39FF14;">FlexGl</span><span style="color:#FF073A;">O</span>?</h1>

<p>Imagine a shirt that transforms your body into a living canvas of motion and energy.<br />
This isn’t just a garment—it’s a gateway to visualizing the power within. Using cutting-edge <strong>EMG (electromyography)</strong> sensors strategically placed across key upper-body muscle groups, this innovative shirt detects even the subtlest electrical signals generated by muscle activation. The result? A spectacular symphony of light, brought to life by vibrant <strong>LEDs</strong>, dynamically illuminating your movements in real-time. Witness the light of your own heart pulse on your chest, captured via <strong>EKG (electrocardiogram)</strong>.</p>

<p>Are you cheating on your curls? Now we can see that you are. Quantify muscle imbalances or movement weaknesses as <strong>5 BLE nodes</strong> collect data across the body for rehab or performance purposes. Fitness analytics at the speed of light. Are you giving maximum effort in every rep? Simply glance at your mobile device to see the voltage output and muscle activity in real-time.</p>

<hr />

<p>Take control of your fitness journey like never before. With <span style="color:#39FF14;">FlexGl</span><span style="color:#FF073A;">O</span>, the future of wearable fitness technology is here.</p>

<h2 id="the-initial-idea">The Initial Idea</h2>

<p>We wanted a shirt that could light-up in real-time showing muscle muscle activation as a bar of illuminated LEDs. You could check your form, you could maximize effort, you could show off. We wanted to use EMG sensors and EKG sensors too</p>

<p>(Write more about the idea here. Describe the origins, goals, or inspirations behind your project.)</p>
